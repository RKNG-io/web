# UX Audit  -  4 December 2024

## Summary

The Reckoning web application demonstrates strong brand voice consistency and thoughtful UX patterns, but suffers from critical navigational friction, inconsistent CTAs, and several accessibility gaps that could prevent solo business owners from completing the journey. The primary issues centre around confusing dual entry points, services page indecision, and missing accessibility fundamentals.

## Critical Issues (fix now)

### 1. Dual service pages with no clear winner
Both VersionA and VersionB exist in production with toggle via `?v=b` query parameter. This creates maintenance debt and dilutes the experience.
- **Fix**: Pick ONE version based on user testing or business goals. Remove the other entirely.
- **Files**: `src/app/services/page.tsx` (lines 10-19), `VersionA.tsx`, `VersionB.tsx`

### 2. Confusing dual CTAs on hero
Hero offers "Get Your Reckoning  -  Free" AND "I know what I need" side-by-side (Hero.tsx:34-47), but psychology brief emphasises both paths should feel equally valid. Currently the secondary button styling makes "I know what I need" feel subordinate.
- **Fix**: Either make both buttons equally prominent visually (both solid colours, different hues) OR restructure as single primary CTA with subtle secondary link below.
- **File**: `src/components/landing/Hero.tsx` (lines 34-47)

### 3. Broken navigation anchor on landing
Nav links to `#support` but the Packages section uses `id="support"` (Packages.tsx:49). However, Nav.tsx (line 23) references "Services" which doesn't match any section heading.
- **Fix**: Align anchor IDs, nav labels, and section headings.
- **Files**: `src/components/layout/Nav.tsx` (line 23), `src/components/landing/Packages.tsx` (line 49)

### 4. No skip link for keyboard users
Fixed nav covers hero content on scroll. Keyboard users have no way to skip repetitive navigation links.
- **Fix**: Add visually-hidden skip link as first focusable element.
- **File**: `src/components/layout/Nav.tsx` (after line 27)

### 5. Progress indicator uses off-brand colour
ProgressBar.tsx line 19 uses `text-gray-500` which isn't in the brand palette.
- **Fix**: Replace `text-gray-500` with `text-charcoal/60`
- **File**: `src/app/start/ProgressBar.tsx` (line 19)

### 6. "Complete" button misleading
Questionnaire "Continue" button says "Complete" on last question but then shows "Preparing your Reckoning" screen. Users expect completion when clicking "Complete →" but see another loading state.
- **Fix**: Change last question button text to "View My Reckoning →" or keep "Continue →" throughout.
- **File**: `src/app/start/QuestionCard.tsx` (line 201)

## High Priority (fix soon)

### Footer links to non-existent pages
Footer includes links to `/about`, `/contact`, `/privacy`, `/terms` which likely return 404s.
- **Fix**: Either build these pages or remove links until ready.
- **File**: `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` (lines 55-87)

### Inconsistent CTA copy across journey
- Hero: "Get Your Reckoning  -  Free"
- Nav: "Get Your Reckoning" (no "free")
- HowItWorks: "Get Your Reckoning  -  Free"
- FinalCTA: "Get Your Reckoning  -  Free"
- Packages: "Get started" (completely different)
- **Fix**: Standardise on ONE primary CTA phrase everywhere.

### Services page discount tiers inconsistent
VersionA says "add 2+ for 5% off, 4+ for 10% off", VersionB says "2+ services: 5% off • 4+ services: 10% off • 6+ services: 15% off".
- **Fix**: Unify discount structure across versions before picking one.

### Mobile menu doesn't close on scroll
If user opens mobile menu then scrolls, menu stays open overlaying content.
- **Fix**: Add scroll listener that closes menu.
- **File**: `src/components/layout/Nav.tsx`

### Questionnaire resume prompt lacks context
"Welcome back" screen is lovely but time-poor users might not remember what "Reckoning" means. No email/name shown.
- **Fix**: Add context like "Welcome back, [name]" and briefly re-state what the Reckoning is.
- **File**: `src/app/start/page.tsx` (lines 95-142)

### BlockedUnlocked rows not obviously tappable
Rows have hover states but no visual affordance for tap on touch devices.
- **Fix**: Add small arrow icon on right side of each row.
- **File**: `src/components/landing/BlockedUnlocked.tsx` (lines 63-88)

## Nice to Have

- FAQ items could show estimated read time
- PersonaCards hover animation doesn't work on touch
- Benefits section links feel premature in journey
- Outcome pages have footer nav but landing doesn't (inconsistent)
- Questionnaire card fixed min-height causes awkward spacing
- Loading states use emoji instead of spinner

## Flow Improvements

1. **Add micro-copy after persona selection** that says "Great choice. This takes 12 minutes. You can pause anytime."

2. **Replace numeric progress with stage-based labels** as per psychology brief ("Getting to know you" → "What's in the way")

3. **Optional email capture after persona selection** for progress recovery

4. **Add "back to my Reckoning" link** on services page when arriving from report

5. **Decide on /start/choose**: Keep lightweight bypass OR redirect to `/services` with pre-filter

## Key Insight

> The application has strong bones but suffers from "two paths syndrome"  -  multiple ways to do the same thing creates cognitive load for time-poor users. **Ruthlessly remove optionality** to create clearer, faster paths to value.
