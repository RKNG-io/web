Spend 2-3 hours on client work that actually requires partner-level input, then get pulled into reviewing associate work, approving standard engagement letters I've seen 100 times, and double-checking time entries. End the day at 7pm knowing I'm the reason we can't take on more profitable work because everything waits for my review.",

Then I'm manually writing down new enquiries on whatever paper I can find, which I'll probably lose by lunch. I spend ages going back and forth with people trying to book sessions because our booking system is rubbish and half the trainers don't even use it properly. I'm constantly checking if trainers have actually logged their sessions, chasing invoices that should have gone out weeks ago, and trying to remember which member said what about their goals. By 2pm I've got three different notebooks with different information and I'm already behind on everything. The phone rings constantly with people asking about availability and I'm checking three different systems to give them an answer. I'll deal with the accounting later, I'll update the member database later, I'll follow up with that lead later - except later never comes and things just pile up.",
