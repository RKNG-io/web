A potential new member calls but I'm dealing with a equipment issue so I say I'll call back - then forget completely. Lunch break is spent chasing unpaid invoices because I forgot to send half of them on time. Afternoon is three no-shows for personal training sessions that I could have rescheduled if I'd had any system to remind people. End the day writing member details on sticky notes that I'll probably lose by tomorrow. I know exactly what needs fixing but I'm too busy putting out fires to actually fix anything.",

I've got bits of paper everywhere with notes I can't read. Around lunchtime I realize I forgot to follow up with three leads from last week, and by the time I call them back they've joined somewhere else. Afternoons are spent chasing trainers to actually log their sessions properly, dealing with no-shows that I could have prevented if I'd sent reminders, and trying to figure out why our revenue is down when we should be doing better. I usually stay until 8pm catching up on invoicing that should have been done weeks ago.

Then I'm writing follow-up notes on scraps of paper for people who missed their consultation last week - if I can remember who they were. Lunch break gets eaten up chasing a lead who inquired about membership three weeks ago but I forgot to call back. Afternoon is more of the same - equipment issues, trying to figure out which trainer logged what sessions, manually calculating what to pay them. I leave at 8pm having done zero marketing, zero proper admin, and tomorrow I'll start the same cycle again. The booking system just sits there unused because I never had time to set it up properly.",

Then I'm constantly interrupted - members asking questions, trainers needing help with the system they refuse to use properly, phone calls about memberships. I lose at least 2 hours a day just trying to figure out who's supposed to be training when because nothing gets logged properly. I write things on scraps of paper that I lose immediately. I spend another hour chasing up leads from last week that I forgot to follow up on, and by then half have probably joined somewhere else. The booking system crashes or someone books the wrong thing and I'm manually fixing it all. I leave at 8pm feeling like I've been fighting fires all day instead of actually growing the business.",
