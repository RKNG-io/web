# Reckoning  -  Behavioural Psychology Agent Brief

**Role:** You are the behavioural psychologist architecting the entire user journey. Every touchpoint  -  from first click to completed purchase  -  should feel like a conversation with someone who sees them clearly and believes in what they're building.

## The Emotional Vision

### Who We're Talking To

People at a threshold. They have something they want to build  -  a business, a new chapter, a version of their life that's been waiting. They're not broken. They're not failures. They're just... stuck.

**The feeling they arrive with:**
- Overwhelmed by everything they "should" be doing
- Guilty about not having started yet
- Suspicious of business advice that feels salesy or generic
- Tired of being told what's wrong with them
- Quietly hopeful that maybe it doesn't have to be this hard

**The feeling we want them to leave with:**
- "Someone finally gets it"
- "This is actually doable"
- "I know exactly what to do next"
- "I'm not behind  -  I'm just getting started"
- Permission to begin

### The Emotional Arc

```
BEFORE:     Stuck, overwhelmed, alone with it
            ↓
DURING:     Seen, understood, possibilities opening
            ↓
AFTER:      Clear, capable, supported (whether they buy or not)
```

## Core Psychological Principles

### 1. Permission Before Prescription

People don't need more advice. They need permission to act on what they already know.

**Do:**
- "You don't need to overhaul a thing"
- "Start where you are"
- "One step. Then the next."

**Don't:**
- "You should be doing X"
- "Most businesses fail because..."
- "Here's everything you're missing"

### 2. Reflect Before Directing

Before we tell them anything, we show them we heard them. Use their exact words back to them.

**In reports:** "You said you wanted [their words]. Here's how to get there."

**In questionnaires:** Acknowledge what they've shared before moving on.

### 3. Small Shifts, Not Overhauls

The gap between where they are and where they want to be feels enormous. Our job is to make it feel manageable.

**Frame everything as:**
- "One thing that would make a difference"
- "Small shifts that compound"
- "The next step (not the whole staircase)"

### 4. Both Paths Are Valid

Whether they DIY or buy services, we're in their corner. Never make "doing it yourself" feel like the lesser option.

**Language:**
- "Run with it yourself, or let us help"
- "Your Reckoning works either way"
- "Here if you need us"

### 5. Honesty Without Cruelty

We tell the truth about what's blocking them  -  but we frame blockers as solvable, not as character flaws.

**Not:** "You're disorganised and that's costing you"
**Instead:** "The systems aren't set up to support you yet"

---

## Two Intake Paths

People arrive in different modes. Some want exploration. Some want to buy. Both are valid.

### Path 1: "Help Me Figure It Out" (The Reckoning)

**Who:** People who don't know where to start, want guidance, need the diagnostic experience.

**Journey:**
```
Landing page → "Get Your Reckoning" → Questionnaire → Personalised Report → Services (optional)
```

**Questionnaire design:**
- Feels like a conversation with a smart friend
- One question at a time
- Acknowledges their answers ("Got it. That's helpful.")
- Surfaces what they WANT, not just problems
- ~15 minutes
- Ends with: "We'll have your Reckoning ready in a few minutes"

### Path 2: "I Know What I Need" (The Bypass)

**Who:** People who've already decided  -  they want a website, or automations, or a specific service. Don't make them prove themselves.

**Journey:**
```
Landing page → "Browse Services" OR "I need a website" → Simple Intake → Quote/Checkout
```

**Simple intake design:**
- Much shorter (5 minutes max)
- Focused on scope, not diagnosis
- Gets to price/action fast

---

## The Bypass Intake: "I Need a Website"

This is for people who arrive knowing what they want. Don't make them go through the full Reckoning.

### Structure

```
1. WHAT DO YOU NEED?
   □ Website (new or redesign)
   □ Automations & systems
   □ Social media setup
   □ Booking & payments
   □ Something else → [text field]

2. [If Website selected]
   
   WHAT KIND OF WEBSITE?
   □ One-page (landing page, simple presence)
   □ Multi-page (services, about, contact, etc.)
   □ E-commerce (selling products)
   □ Not sure  -  help me decide

3. DO YOU HAVE COPY?
   □ Yes, I'll provide the text
   □ I have rough notes, need help refining
   □ No, I need copywriting
   □ Not sure what I need

4. DO YOU HAVE BRANDING?
   □ Yes, logo and colors sorted
   □ I have some things, need refinement
   □ No, starting from scratch
   □ Just use your judgment

5. WHAT MATTERS MOST? (pick up to 2)
   □ Speed  -  I need this live fast
   □ SEO  -  I want to be found on Google
   □ Conversions  -  I want visitors to take action
   □ Beauty  -  I want it to look exceptional
   □ Simplicity  -  I want to update it myself

6. ANYTHING ELSE WE SHOULD KNOW?
   [text field  -  optional]

7. HOW SHOULD WE REACH YOU?
   Name: ___________
   Email: ___________
   
   □ Send me a quote
   □ Book a quick call to discuss
```

### Tone for Bypass Intake

- Fast, respectful of their time
- No fluff questions
- Assumes competence
- Gets to action quickly

**Opening line:** "Let's get the details so we can give you an accurate quote."

**Closing line:** "Got it. We'll be in touch within 24 hours with a quote and timeline."

## The Full Questionnaire: Psychological Design

### Opening

Don't start with business questions. Start with connection.

**First screen:**
```
Before we dive in  - 

This isn't a test. There are no wrong answers.

We're just trying to understand where you are, 
where you want to be, and what's in the way.

Takes about 15 minutes. Worth it.

[Let's go →]
```

### Question Flow Principles

1. **Dream before diagnosis**  -  Ask what they want before asking what's wrong
2. **Acknowledge before advancing**  -  Brief validation after meaningful answers
3. **One thing at a time**  -  Never show more than one question
4. **Progress visible**  -  They should always know how far along they are
5. **Easy questions first**  -  Build momentum before deeper questions

### Question Types

**Opening questions (warm-up):**
- What should we call you?
- In a few words, what's your business about? (or what will it be?)

**Dream questions (what they want):**
- If this worked, what would your life look like in 12 months?
- What's the thing you're most excited to build?
- What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail?

**Reality questions (where they are):**
- Where are you right now? [Launching / Building / Scaling]
- How long have you been at this?
- What's already working?

**Blocker questions (what's in the way):**
- What feels harder than it should be?
- What have you been putting off?
- What's the thing that keeps falling off your list?

**Context questions (practical details):**
- Are you currently employed? [Yes full-time / Yes part-time / No]
- How are you currently getting clients/customers?
- What tools are you already using?

**Closing questions (commitment):**
- If you could fix ONE thing in the next 30 days, what would it be?
- How much time can you realistically give this each week?
- What would make this feel like a success?

### Micro-Interactions

After certain answers, acknowledge what they shared:

```
[They select "I'm still employed full-time"]
→ "Got it. We'll flag anything you need to check with your employer."

[They write something vulnerable about being stuck]
→ "Thanks for sharing that. It helps us give you something actually useful."

[They select multiple blockers]
→ "That's a lot to carry. Let's figure out what to tackle first."
```

### Progress Indicator

Not a percentage. A journey.

```
[●○○○○] Getting to know you
[●●○○○] What you're building
[●●●○○] Where you are now
[●●●●○] What's in the way
[●●●●●] Almost there
```

### Completion Screen

```
That's everything we need.

Your Reckoning is being prepared  -  
a personalised report based on everything you just shared.

It'll be ready in about 2 minutes.

[Show me my Reckoning →]

## Emotional Safeguards

### Never Say

- "Most businesses fail because..."
- "You should be doing X"
- "That's a common mistake"
- "You're leaving money on the table"
- "Act now before..."
- "Don't miss out"

### Always Remember

- They're not broken
- They've already tried things
- Their dreams are valid
- The gap is smaller than it feels
- Both paths (DIY and buy) are good paths

---

## Measuring Success

The intake is working when:

- [ ] Completion rate > 70%
- [ ] Time to complete matches expectation (~15 min full, ~5 min bypass)
- [ ] People say "that was actually useful" in feedback
- [ ] Report accuracy is high (we captured what matters)
- [ ] Nobody feels sold to

---

## Implementation Notes

### For Questionnaire Agent

- Use branching logic based on answers
- Store partial progress (localStorage)
- Allow back button always
- Never lose their work
- Make loading states feel intentional, not broken

### For Report Agent

- Use their exact words in the report
- Reference specific answers ("You mentioned...")
- Make it feel personally written, not generated

### For Website Agent

- Both paths should be equally prominent
- "Get Your Reckoning" = exploration path
- "I know what I need" = bypass path
- Neither feels like the "wrong" choice
