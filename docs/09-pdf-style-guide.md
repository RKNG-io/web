# Reckoning Report — PDF Style Guide

## Overview

The Reckoning PDF is the moment of truth — a beautifully designed, personalised document that makes people feel *seen* and gives them a clear path forward. It's not a sales pitch. It's a diagnosis that naturally leads to action.

**Two outcomes, equal validity:**
1. **Purchase services** — they know what they need, ready to buy
2. **Book a discovery call** — they want to talk it through first

Both are wins. The PDF should make either feel like the obvious next step.

## Colour Palette in PDF

### Primary Usage

| Colour | Hex | Use in PDF |
|--------|-----|------------|
| Charcoal | #2d2926 | Cover background, section headers, text |
| Ice | #F2F6F9 | Page backgrounds, card fills |
| White | #FFFFFF | Content areas, cards |
| Fuchsia | #D14BA8 | CTAs, accent lines, key numbers, links |
| Mint | #B6E2D3 | Positive highlights, "you're doing well" |
| Blue | #A8C3D1 | Secondary elements, dividers |

### Accent Rules

- **Fuchsia**: Action items, CTAs, important numbers, links — never backgrounds
- **Mint**: Success states, things they're doing right, the "after" state
- **Blue**: Neutral sections, supporting info, less urgent items

## Page Structure

### Page 1: Cover

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Design notes:**
- Personalised immediately — their name is the hero
- Subtle radial gradient (fuchsia at 5% opacity) in corner
- Clean, confident, premium feel
- No clutter

### Page 2: The Mirror (Opening)

**Purpose:** Reflect back what they told us. Make them feel heard.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│                                         │

│                                         │

│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Content guidance:**
- Use their exact words in the pull quote
- Reference specific answers (business type, stage, goals)
- Warm, not clinical
- Sets up: "we listened, now here's what we found"

---

### Page 3: The Snapshot (Where You Are)

**Purpose:** Clear-eyed assessment of current state. No judgement.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  WHERE YOU ARE                          │  ← Fuchsia label

│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Content guidance:**
- Always start with what's working (builds trust)
- "What's missing" is neutral — gaps, not failures
- "What's costing you" is specific to their inputs
- Each point should trace back to a questionnaire answer

### Page 4: The Diagnosis

**Purpose:** The insight. What's really going on.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  THE DIAGNOSIS                          │  ← Fuchsia label
│                                         │

│  This isn't about working harder.       │

│  └─────────────────────────────────────┘│
│                                         │
│  Based on what you've shared, you're    │
│  spending [X hours/week] on things      │
│  that should be automated or delegated. │
│                                         │
│  That's [calculated cost] per year      │  ← Fuchsia number
│  in lost opportunity.                   │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Content guidance:**
- This is where the magic happens
- Synthesis, not just summary
- One core insight, clearly stated
- Specific numbers from their inputs (hours worked, rates, etc.)
- Never generic — always personal

**Pull quote rules:**
- Never use "The real problem isn't X. It's Y." — that's patronising
- Don't explain what they already know
- Instead: reframe, give permission, or surface something they felt but hadn't articulated
- Good: "You've been waiting to feel ready. You already are."
- Good: "The gap between helping people and having a business is about six hours of setup."
- Bad: "The real problem isn't that you don't know how to coach. It's that you don't have a front door."

### Page 5: The Fix (Journey Map)

**Purpose:** Prioritised action items. What to do, in order.

│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Content guidance:**
- Maximum 5 items on this page (prioritised)
- Each item: what, why, time estimate, impact level
- "DO THIS →" links to:
  - Service page (if we offer it)
  - Resource page (if DIY)
  - Dashboard checklist item
- Never overwhelming — they can see more online

### Page 6: The Cost of Waiting

**Purpose:** Urgency without panic. Real stakes, their numbers.

```

**Content guidance:**
- All numbers derived from their questionnaire
- Revenue = their rate × hours lost to admin × weeks
- Contrast: "if nothing changes" vs "if you start now"
- Emotional but grounded — never manipulative
- The mint box is the vision, the goal state

**Content guidance:**
- DIY path is genuinely supported — not a throwaway
- "Do it with us" shows their recommended package
- Individual services option always visible (from £79)
- Discovery call is the third path — never pushy
- "No pitch. Just clarity." — matches brand voice

**Content guidance:**
- ONE action only — the most important thing
- Specific: "Register your domain" not "Get started"
- Achievable in 24 hours
- The CTA links to either:
  - A service purchase page
  - A resource/how-to
  - A booking link
- Ends with warmth, not pressure

## Tone by Section

| Section | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Cover | Confident, personal | [Their name] — no preamble |
| Mirror | Warm, listening | "You told us..." |
| Snapshot | Clear-eyed, fair | "What's working... what's missing" |
| Diagnosis | Insightful, direct | Reframe or give permission |
| Roadmap | Practical, prioritised | "First this, then this" |
| Cost | Honest, not scary | "What another year looks like" |
| Path Forward | Supportive, options | "Two ways to move" |
| One Thing | Energising, focused | "Your one next step" |

### Tone Rules

**Never:**
- "The real problem isn't X. It's Y." — patronising
- "What you need to understand is..." — condescending
- "You might not realise that..." — assumes ignorance
- "Let me explain..." — positions us as teacher
- Explaining back to them what they just told us

**Instead:**
- Reframe: "The gap is smaller than it feels."
- Give permission: "You've been waiting to feel ready. You already are."
- Validate: "That stuck feeling makes sense."
- Be specific: Use their numbers, their words, their situation

## Generating the PDF

### Technical Approach

**Option 1: React-PDF**
- Generate in-browser or via API
- Full control over layout
- Use `@react-pdf/renderer`

**Option 2: HTML → PDF Service**
- Render HTML template, convert via Puppeteer or PDFShift
- Easier to style, less precise control
- Faster to iterate

**Option 3: Hybrid**
- Generate web version, offer "Download PDF" via API
- Web version is primary, PDF is artifact

### Recommended: Option 3

```
1. Generate Reckoning as structured JSON
2. Render on web at /reckoning/[id]
3. "Download PDF" button calls /api/pdf/[id]
4. API renders same data into PDF template
5. Return PDF with filename: "[Name]-Reckoning-[Date].pdf"
```

---

## File Naming

```
[FirstName]-Reckoning-[YYYY-MM-DD].pdf
```

Examples:
- `Sarah-Reckoning-2025-01-15.pdf`
- `Marcus-Reckoning-2025-01-15.pdf`
