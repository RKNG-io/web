# Reckoning - Business Model v3

## The Vision

**Reckoning helps business owners stop working for their business and start having their business work for them.**

We're not an agency. We're not a course. We're the bridge between the life you're living and the one you've been waiting to build.

---

## The Core Insight

People don't need more advice. They need:

1. **Clarity** - What's actually blocking them
2. **Permission** - To start where they are
3. **Action** - Small shifts that compound
4. **Support** - When they want it (not forced)

The Reckoning gives them 1-3 for free. Services give them 4 when they're ready.

## Two Paths In

### Path 1: "Help me figure it out"
**The Reckoning** - Free diagnostic

```
Questionnaire (15 min) → Personalised Report → Clarity on what's blocking them
                                              → Prioritised next steps
                                              → Option to DIY or get help
```

**Why free?**
- Zero friction to value
- Builds trust before asking for money
- Captures qualified leads with real context
- The report itself is the sales conversation

### Path 2: "I know what I need"
**Bypass Intake** - Direct to quote

```
"I need a website" → Simple intake (5 min) → Quote within 24 hours
```

**Why offer this?**
- Respects people who've already decided
- Faster path to revenue
- Not everyone needs diagnosis

## Who We Serve

### Launcher
**Where they are:** Still employed, planning, dreaming, haven't started yet.

**What's blocking them:**
- "I don't know where to start"
- "I need to check my employment contract"
- "I'm not ready yet"

**What unlocks them:**
- Permission to begin
- A clear first step
- Foundation they can build on

### Builder
**Where they are:** Running, but doing everything themselves. Busy but stuck.

**What's blocking them:**
- "It's easier to do it myself"
- "I don't have time to set up systems"
- "Chasing invoices feels awkward"

**What unlocks them:**
- Automations that sound like them
- Systems that give time back
- Growth without hiring

### Architect
**Where they are:** Successful, but capped. The business can't run without them.

**What's blocking them:**
- "I am the bottleneck"
- "I need to hire to scale"
- "I can't step back"

**What unlocks them:**
- Operations that don't depend on them
- AI-powered workflows
- Scale without headcount

## Revenue Model

### À La Carte Services (Primary)

The Reckoning diagnostic recommends specific services based on what's actually blocking each person. No forced bundles - they buy what they need, come back when ready for more.

| Category | Examples | Price Range |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Presence** | Website, domain, email, link hub | £49-£399 |
| **Operations** | Booking, payments, invoicing, CRM | £79-£299 |
| **Automation** | Email sequences, workflows, social systems | £99-£249 |
| **Visibility** | Google Business, SEO basics, multi-location | £79-£249 |
| **Support** | Strategy sessions, audits, training | £99-£299 |

**Multi-service discounts:**
- 2+ services: 5% off
- 4+ services: 10% off
- 6+ services: 15% off

**Why à la carte over packages:**
- A bigger business may need less (just one thing fixed)
- Doing one thing well builds trust for the next purchase
- People buy what they actually need, not a bundle with padding
- Lower barrier to first purchase
- Higher lifetime value through repeat purchases

### Retainers (Ongoing Support)

| Tier | Price | What's Included |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Lite** | £79/mo | Hosting, updates, email support, one small tweak per month |
| **Standard** | £149/mo | Monthly check-in call, priority support, 2-3 tweaks per month |

| **Automation logic** | Smart workflows that adapt |

## Customer Journey

```
1. ARRIVE
   Landing page - two clear paths:
   "Get Your Reckoning" (exploration)
   "I know what I need" (bypass)

2. INTAKE
   Path A: Full questionnaire (15 min) → Personalised report
   Path B: Simple intake (5 min) → Quote

3. RECKONING (Path A only)
   Personalised report:
   - What you're building
   - What's blocking you
   - What unlocks it
   - Your path (prioritised steps)
   - Recommended services (specific to them)

4. DECIDE
   DIY with the roadmap
   OR
   Get help with one specific thing

5. DELIVER
   Build → Review → Handover → Support

6. EXPAND (natural, not pushed)
   "That worked well, can you help with X?"
   OR
   Retainer for ongoing support
```

## Key Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Capacity** - you're the bottleneck | Templatise, hire VA, raise prices |
| **Price objections** - "just a website" | Lead with Reckoning (value), not deliverables |
| **Scope creep** | Clear scoping, change request process |
| **AI commoditisation** | Emphasise taste, curation, done-for-you |
| **One-and-done clients** | Excellent delivery → natural expansion |

---

## The Moat

1. **The Reckoning** - Proprietary diagnostic that builds trust before sale
2. **Human-sounding automations** - Their invoices, follow-ups, and sequences don't read like a robot wrote them
3. **Permission-giving** - Emotional positioning competitors don't have
4. **Speed** - Days, not weeks
5. **Independence** - They own everything, no lock-in
6. **Land and expand** - One thing done well leads to the next

---

*You don't need to overhaul a thing. Fix what's blocking you now. Come back when you're ready for the next step.*
