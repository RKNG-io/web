# Reckoning — Business Model v2

## The Vision

**Reckoning helps business owners stop working for their business and start having their business work for them.**

We're not an agency. We're not a course. We're the bridge between the life you're living and the one you've been waiting to build.

---

## The Core Insight

People don't need more advice. They need:

1. **Clarity** — What's actually blocking them
2. **Permission** — To start where they are
3. **Action** — Small shifts that compound
4. **Support** — When they want it (not forced)

The Reckoning gives them 1–3 for free. Services give them 4 when they're ready.

## Two Paths In

### Path 1: "Help me figure it out"
**The Reckoning** — Free diagnostic

```
Questionnaire (15 min) → Personalised Report → Clarity on what's blocking them
                                              → Prioritised next steps
                                              → Option to DIY or get help
```

**Why free?**
- Zero friction to value
- Builds trust before asking for money
- Captures qualified leads with real context
- The report itself is the sales conversation

### Path 2: "I know what I need"
**Bypass Intake** — Direct to quote

```
"I need a website" → Simple intake (5 min) → Quote within 24 hours
```

**Why offer this?**
- Respects people who've already decided
- Faster path to revenue
- Not everyone needs diagnosis

- "Chasing invoices feels awkward"

**What unlocks them:**
- Automations that sound like them

**What unlocks them:**

## Key Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Capacity** — you're the bottleneck | Templatise, hire VA, raise prices |
| **Price objections** — "just a website" | Lead with Reckoning (value), not deliverables |
| **Scope creep** | Clear scoping, change request process |
| **AI commoditisation** | Emphasise taste, curation, done-for-you |

---

## The Moat

1. **The Reckoning** — Proprietary diagnostic that builds trust before sale
2. **Voice match** — AI trained on their voice, not generic
3. **Permission-giving** — Emotional positioning competitors don't have
4. **Speed** — Days, not weeks
5. **Independence** — They own everything, no lock-in

---

*You don't need to overhaul a thing. Introduce automations that sound like you. Build systems that let you grow without burning out.*
