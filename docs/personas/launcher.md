# Launcher Persona

## Who They Are

People at the very beginning. Still employed, or just starting out. Dreaming but not yet doing.

## The Feeling

- Excited but uncertain
- Wants permission
- Scared of making the wrong move
- "I've been thinking about this for years"

## What They Need

- Clarity on what actually matters to launch (not everything)
- A simple system for getting paid and getting found
- Space to focus on the work, not the setup
- Permission to begin

## Primary Beat

**Unblock** — clarity, permission to start

## Messaging

**Acknowledge:**
> It's hard to start when you're still figuring it out. The gap between "I want to do this" and "I'm actually doing this" can feel huge.

**Reframe:**
> It's not. You don't need a perfect plan. You need a first step — and someone in your corner while you take it.

## CTA Energy

> Start small. Start now. We'll figure it out together.

## Tone

- Encouraging, calm
- Never patronising
- Like a friend who's been there
