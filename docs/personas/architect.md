# Architect Persona

## Who They Are

Established, successful, but capped. The business can't run without them. They've built something real but it's running them.

## The Feeling

- Successful but stretched
- Ready for the next level but unsure how
- Can't take a holiday without things breaking
- "I didn't build this to be trapped by it"

## What They Need

- Operations that don't depend on them for every decision
- AI and automation that handles client comms, reporting, admin
- Space to think about growth, impact, what's next
- Systems that let them step back

## Primary Beat

**Unleash** — scale, space for what's next

## Messaging

**Acknowledge:**
> You've built something real. But right now, it can't run without you — and that's a ceiling.

**Reframe:**
> The next level isn't about working harder. It's about building systems that free up space — mental, emotional, practical — so you can focus on what's next.

## CTA Energy

> You've done the hard part. Let's build what comes next.

4. When did you last take a proper holiday?
5. What is this costing you outside of work?
