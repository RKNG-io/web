# Builder Persona

## Who They Are

Running a business, but doing everything themselves. Busy but stuck. Making it work with duct tape.

## The Feeling

- Stretched thin
- Constant context-switching
- Working *in* the business, not *on* it
- "I know I need systems but I don't have time to set them up"

## What They Need

- Automations that handle the repetitive stuff
- A way to show up online without it eating their week
- Space to work *on* the business, not just *in* it
- Systems that give time back without hiring

## Primary Beat

**Unlock** — systems, time back

## Messaging

**Acknowledge:**
> When you're the one doing everything — the work, the emails, the invoices, the posting — it's hard to find space to think, let alone grow.

**Reframe:**
> You don't need to hire a team. You need systems that handle the repetitive stuff — so you can focus on the work that actually moves the needle.

## CTA Energy

> Get your time back. One system at a time.

## Tone

- Practical, relieving
- Like a peer who found a shortcut
- Never hustle-bro

5. What's the ONE thing that would make the biggest difference?
