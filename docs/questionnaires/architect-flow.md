# Architect Questionnaire Flow

## Opening Screen

```
You built something real.

Employees. Customers. Revenue. Responsibility.

But somewhere along the way, the thing you built started running you.

This isn't about working harder. It's about building the systems
that let you step back  -  and have it all keep working.

These questions are direct. I need to understand what's actually happening,
not the version you tell people at networking events.

Takes about 12 minutes. Could save you 10 hours a week.
