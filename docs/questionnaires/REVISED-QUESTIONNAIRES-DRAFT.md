# Revised Questionnaires - Draft for Review

## Philosophy

**Launcher** - Keep emotional/permission-giving. They need clarity on what they're building and permission to start.

**Builder & Architect** - Practical time/task audit:
- Where does your time go?
- What tasks annoy you?
- What do you keep putting off?
- What drains your energy?

**Key insight:** They don't know what can be automated - that's our job. We ask about pain, we identify the fix.

```
They say: "I spend 3 hours a week chasing invoices"
We say:  "That can be automated. Here's how. £79."
```

The diagnosis still uses **blocked/unlocked** framing (good brand language). The change is the output - less narrative insight, more "here's what fixes it and what it costs."

---

## Launcher (Permission-giving, simplified)

Keep the emotional flow. They're pre-launch and need:
- Clarity on what they're building
- Permission to start
- A checklist of what's in place vs missing

### Simplified Business Type Question

**Current (too many options):**
```
coaching, creative, fitness, food, therapy, professional, trades, ecommerce, other
```

**Revised - ask what they DO, not what category:**

**"What will you do for people?"** (single)
- Help them solve a problem (coaching, consulting, therapy)
- Make or build something for them (design, photography, trades)
- Teach them something (courses, tutoring, workshops)
- Sell them a product (physical or digital)
- Something else

This is simpler, more intuitive for someone who doesn't know "what they are" yet. We infer business type from this + their free text answers.

### Key questions to keep:
- Who do you help?
- What will you do for people? (simplified)
- Why now?
- What's in place already? (checklist)
- What feels broken or missing?
- What's actually stopping you?
- Timeline, income goals, etc.

### Minor tweaks:
- Make "what's in place" more comprehensive (pull from business-type checklists)
- Add industry-specific follow-up based on what they do

## Builder (Rewritten - Time/Task Audit)

### Welcome
```
You're making it work. Let's see where the time goes.

This isn't about feelings. It's about facts - how you spend your hours,

## Architect (Rewritten - Operations Audit)

### Welcome
```
You built something real. Let's see what's running you.

Takes 10-12 minutes. Be blunt.

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Current | Revised |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Focus** | Feelings, blockers, what's broken | Time allocation, tasks, operations |
| **Insight source** | Self-reported blockers | Patterns in how they spend time |
| **Tone** | Warm, permission-giving | Direct, practical, audit-style |
| **Output** | "Here's what's blocking you" | "You spend X hours on Y - here's how to fix it" |

## Report Output - More Action-Oriented

The report should read like a consultant's findings, not a life coach's insight.

### Current Problem

The current report is too narrative:
- "You're blocked by X"
- "What would unlock this is Y"
- Long explanation of why
- Journey map with phases
- Eventually... action items

### Revised Approach

Lead with the fix. Be prescriptive.

**Structure for Builder/Architect:**

```
1. THE SITUATION (brief)
   "You're spending 8 hours a week on invoicing and chasing payments."

2. WHAT'S BLOCKING YOU (specific)
   - Manual invoicing after every job
   - No automated reminders
   - Pricing made up on the spot

3. WHAT FIXES IT (prescriptive)
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ FIX: Invoicing System                                   │
   │                                                         │
   │ What it does: Auto-generates invoices, sends reminders, │
   │ tracks who's paid.                                      │
   │                                                         │
   │ Time back: ~6 hours/week                                │
   │ Cost: £79 one-time setup                                │
   │                                                         │
   │ [Get this →]                                            │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

4. YOUR ACTION LIST
   Priority order. Mix of DIY and services.

   □ Set up Stripe account (DIY - 30 mins)
   □ Invoicing system setup (£79) ← we do this
   □ Create pricing sheet (DIY - 2 hours)
   □ Booking system (£99) ← we do this

5. IF YOU DO NOTHING
   "At 8 hours/week × £50/hour = £400/week in lost time.
   That's £20,800/year spent chasing invoices."
```

### Key Differences

| Current | Revised |
|---------|---------|
| "Here's your blocker" | "Here's what fixes it" |
| Narrative explanation | Concrete recommendation |
| Journey phases | Priority action list |
| DIY path vs supported path | Mixed list - both together |
| Services mentioned at end | Fix boxes throughout |

### The Fix Box

Every major recommendation gets a "fix box":
- What it does (plain English)
- Time back or benefit
- Cost
- CTA

This makes the report scannable. They can skim and see exactly what we're recommending and what it costs.

### Launcher Exception

Launcher reports can stay more narrative - they need permission and clarity, not an operations audit. But still end with a concrete action list.

## Next Steps

1. Review this draft
2. Decide on questionnaire changes
3. Update report schema and prompts
4. Test with sample data
