## 1. Welcome

> **You're doing it. Let's make it easier.**

> You didn't wait for permission. You figured it out, found clients, made it work.
>
> But "working" and "working well" aren't the same thing.
>
> The next few questions are about getting honest — what's solid, what's duct tape, and what would actually make this feel like a business instead of a hustle.
>
> No judgement. Just clarity.
>
> **[Let's go →]**

## Conditional Logic

**Based on Q2 (business type):**
- Load type-specific checklist items
- Add relevant follow-up questions (portfolio for creatives, client portal for consultants, etc.)

**Based on Q7 (duct tape areas):**
- If "pricing" selected → add follow-up about how they currently price
- If "contracts" selected → ask if they've ever had a scope creep nightmare
- If "boundaries" selected → ask what they wish they could say no to
