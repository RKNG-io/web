## 1. Welcome

> **You built something real.**
>
> Employees. Customers. Revenue. Responsibility.
>
> But somewhere along the way, the thing you built started running you.
>
> This isn't about working harder. It's about building the systems that let you step back — and have it all keep working.
>
> These questions are direct. I need to understand what's actually happening, not the version you tell people at networking events.
>
> Takes about 10 minutes. Could save you 10 hours a week.
>
> **[Let's be honest →]**

## Conditional Logic

**Based on Q3 (shape):**
- Multiple locations → add questions about cross-site visibility, staff consistency
- Online/remote → add questions about async communication, remote team management

**Based on Q4 (team size):**
- 10+ staff → add questions about middle management, delegation layers
- 1–3 → simpler recommendations, owner-operator focus

**Based on Q7 (tools):**
- Industry-specific tool selected → add follow-up about utilisation
- "Spreadsheets for everything" → flag as priority fix
- "Mostly in my head" → flag as critical risk

**Based on Q22 (exit thinking):**
- If considering sale → add "business value" framing throughout report
- "No one would buy this mess" → powerful hook for systematisation
