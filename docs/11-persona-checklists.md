> 
> Traditional scaling means hiring. But many bottleneck tasks don't need a person — they need a system:
>

> |------|---------|---------|
> | Client enquiries | VA triages inbox | AI reads, categorises, drafts response |
> | Status updates | You write them | AI generates from project data |
> | Meeting prep | You review notes | AI summarises history, flags issues |
> | Invoicing | Bookkeeper | Automated from completed work |
> | Reporting | Spreadsheet updates | Dashboard refreshes itself |

## Comparison

| Persona | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Total |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Launcher | 16 | 10 | 8 | **34** |
| Builder | 14 | 13 | 11 | **38** |
| Architect | 9 | 14 | 15 | **38** |

### Key Differences

**Launcher:** Weighted toward foundation — they need to set everything up from scratch. Growth phase is lighter because they need to get running first.

**Builder:** Evenly distributed — they have basics but need systems everywhere. Heavy on operations and automation.

**Architect:** Weighted toward later phases — foundation is about clarity and assessment, real work is AI-powered delegation and strategy.

## AI-Powered Services We Build

**Not gimmicky. Practical.**

These aren't chatbots that say "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that." These are purpose-built systems that do specific jobs:

### For Builders (Getting Time Back)

| Service | What It Does | Price |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Intake Processor** | Reads enquiries, extracts key info, drafts response for your review | £249 |
| **Follow-Up Engine** | Sends the right email at the right time based on client behaviour | £149 |
| **Review Requester** | Asks happy clients for reviews at the optimal moment | £99 |
| **Content Drafter** | Creates first drafts of posts/emails in your voice | £199 |

### For Architects (Scaling Without Hiring)

| Service | What It Does | Price |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Enquiry Router** | Reads incoming requests, categorises, routes to right person/process | £349 |
| **Status Generator** | Creates client updates from project management data automatically | £299 |
| **Meeting Summariser** | Turns transcripts into action items and follow-ups | £199 |
| **Knowledge Base Bot** | Answers team questions from your documented processes | £399 |
| **Capacity Planner** | Predicts workload and flags when you're heading for trouble | £349 |

### How They Work

1. **You tell us what you need** — We map your current process
2. **We build it** — Custom prompts, integrations, testing
3. **We train it on your voice** — Uses your past communications
4. **You review outputs initially** — Human in the loop until confident
5. **It runs** — You check exceptions, not everything

### What We DON'T Build

- Generic chatbots
- "AI assistants" that need constant babysitting
- Anything that hallucinates to clients without review
- Replacements for actual human relationships

The goal is **leverage**, not replacement. You stay in control. The AI handles the repetitive pattern-matching. You handle the judgment calls.

## Items That Appear in Multiple Personas

Some items are universal but framed differently:

| Item | Launcher | Builder | Architect |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Payment setup | "Set up payment processing" | "Audit and fix payment leaks" | "Review pricing for expertise" |
| CRM | "Create simple client tracker" | "Set up proper CRM" | "Set up client portal" |
| Processes | "Document your process" | "Create templates for recurring tasks" | "Create SOPs for delegation" |
| Testimonials | "Ask for testimonials" | "Collect and display testimonials" | N/A (has them) |

## Callout Boxes by Persona

### Launcher: Employment Warning
```
⚠️ STILL EMPLOYED?
Read your employment contract before you do anything else.
```

### Builder: Payment Psychology
```
💡 THE HIDDEN BENEFIT OF AUTOMATED PAYMENTS
When payment is built in, you never have to ask for money again.
```

### Builder: The New Delegation
```
🤖 YOU DON'T NEED TO HIRE A VA
Many tasks that used to require a person can now be handled 
by well-designed automation. AI reads enquiries, drafts responses,
generates reports, sends follow-ups — and doesn't need training,
holidays, or management.
```

### Architect: The Bottleneck Question
```
🔍 THE REAL QUESTION
If you took a month off tomorrow, what would break?
That's your priority list.
```

### Architect: Beyond Hiring
```
🤖 SCALE WITHOUT HEADCOUNT
Traditional scaling means hiring. But most bottleneck tasks 
don't need a person — they need a system. AI handles the 
pattern-matching. You handle the judgment calls.
```

|---------|-----------|

| First SOP written | "One process documented. What's next?" |

## Report Length by Persona

| Persona | Pages | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Launcher | 10-11 | Comprehensive — they need everything explained |
| Builder | 8-9 | Efficient — they know the basics, show the fixes |
| Architect | 7-8 | Strategic — assessment and delegation focus |

Architect report is shorter because they don't need hand-holding. They need clarity and a plan, not step-by-step instructions.
