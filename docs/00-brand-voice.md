# Reckoning  -  Brand Voice Guide

## The One-Liner

**Unblock. Unlock. Unleash.** Your business. Your way.

---

## The Three Beats

| Beat | What It Means For You |
|------|----------------------|
| **Unblock** | See clearly what's eating your time and energy. No more vague overwhelm  -  just "here's what's in the way." |
| **Unlock** | Get systems that handle the admin, the follow-ups, the invoices. Your voice. Your way. Without hiring. |
| **Unleash** | Get the space to do the next thing. Work on your vision, not your inbox. Grow at your pace, authentically. |

**The through-line:** All three give you space  -  to start, to breathe, to scale.

---

## What We Are

Not a consultancy. Not just coaching. Not just implementation.

**All three  -  mapped to the beats:**

| Beat | Layer | What It Means |
|------|-------|---------------|
| **Unblock** | Coach | We see you. We ask before we tell. We surface what's really in the way. |
| **Unlock** | Builder | We build systems, tools, automation. We remove the weight. |
| **Unleash** | Strategist | We prioritise, activate, and keep you moving toward what matters. |

Most people offer one. We offer all three.

---

## The Core Message

> **You don't need to overhaul a thing. Introduce automations that sound like you. Build systems that let you grow without burning out.**

---

## The Core Belief

You didn't start your business to chase invoices, manage spreadsheets, and stress about social media.

You started it for the work  -  the thing you're actually good at, the impact you want to have, the life you're trying to build.

But somewhere along the way, the admin took over.

We help you take it back.

---

## What You Actually Get

> **Time.** The hours you're losing to emails, invoices, and "I should probably sort that out."
>
> **Space.** Mental, emotional, practical  -  room to think about your business, not just run it.
>
> **Presence.** Show up online in a way that feels like you  -  not performative, not exhausting.
>
> **Systems.** Automations that handle the repetitive stuff, in your voice, your way.
>
> **Clarity.** Know what's blocking you. Know what to do next. Just the next step  -  not the whole life plan.
>
> **Calm.** The quiet confidence that comes from knowing things are handled.

---

## The Feeling We Create

| When They Arrive | When They Leave |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Stretched thin | Space to breathe |
| "I should be further along" | "I know what to do next" |
| Constant pull of things needing attention | Clear on what actually matters |
| Alone with it all | Supported |
| Waiting to feel ready | Already moving |

---

## Feeling Seen

We know what it's like.

The constant context-switching. The background hum of things you haven't got to yet. More time on admin than on the work you actually love. The sense that you're busy all the time but never on the right things.

That's not a character flaw. That's a systems problem.

And systems problems have systems solutions.

---

## The Frame: Blocked By / Unlocked By

This is our core language structure. Everything ladders up to it.

**Not:** "Here's what's wrong with your business"
**Instead:** "Here's what's blocking you → here's what unlocks it"

### Examples

| Blocked By | Unlocked By |
|------------|-------------|
| "I don't know where to start" | A prioritised list of what actually matters |
| "I can't take payment easily" | A booking system that handles it (2 hours to set up) |
| "Social media feels fake" | Permission to do it your way |
| "It's easier to just do it myself" | Automation that sounds like you |
| "I'm still employed  -  can I even do this?" | Knowing exactly what your contract says |
| "I don't want to ask people for money" | Payments built into booking (the conversation disappears) |
| "I need to hire to scale" | Systems that run without headcount |

---

## Tone Principles

### 1. Fiercely In Your Corner
Not soft cheerleading. Not harsh accountability.

We enable  -  removing blockers, building systems, handling the weight.
We empower  -  giving you clarity and tools.
We activate  -  getting you moving, not letting you stay stuck.

We believe in what you're building. We won't let you shrink from it.

### 2. Permission-Giving
They're waiting to feel ready. We help them see they already are.

> "You've been waiting to feel ready. You already are."
> "Start when you're ready. Or start anyway. We're here either way."

### 3. Curiosity Before Prescription
Ask before we tell. Diagnose before we prescribe.

The questionnaire is a conversation, not a form.
The report reflects what they said, not what we assume.

### 4. Simplicity on the Other Side of Complexity
Make the hard stuff doable. Make the path clear.

> "The gap is smaller than it feels."
> "It's easier than you think."

### 5. Take the Work Seriously, Not Ourselves
Confident but not pompous. Expert but not superior.

We've done this before. We know the path. But it's their journey.

## Words We Use

| Use | Because |
|-----|---------|
| Blocked / Unlocked | Frame of possibility, not failure |
| Clear the path | Active, forward motion |
| The weight | What's holding them down (we remove it) |
| Your way | Permission to be authentic |
| Next level | Aspiration, breaking plateaus |
| Build | Active, creative, ownership |
| Systems | Not people, not headcount  -  leverage |
| One life | Stakes without pressure |

---

## Words We Don't Use

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| "Pain points" | Clinical, consultant-speak | "What's blocking you" |
| "Solutions" | Generic, soulless | "What unlocks it" |
| "Leverage" (as verb) | Jargon | "Use" or just cut it |
| "Optimize" | Cold, robotic | "Improve" or "fix" |
| "Scale" (without context) | Overused | "Grow without burning out" |
| "The real problem is..." | Patronising | Just state the insight |
| "What you need to understand..." | Condescending | Don't use |
| "You might not realise..." | Assumes ignorance | Don't use |

---

## Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Homepage hero** | Inviting, energising | "This is your reckoning. Your time is now." |
| **Questionnaire** | Curious, warm | "What would you build if nothing was in the way?" |
| **Diagnosis** | Clear-eyed, empowering | "Here's what's blocking you. Here's what unlocks it." |
| **Checklist** | Practical, achievable | "Phase 1: Clear the path (this week)" |
| **CTA** | Direct, permission-giving | "Start now" / "Get your Reckoning" |
| **Services** | Helpful, no-pressure | "When you're ready for support" |
| **Error states** | Calm, human | "Something went wrong. Let's try that again." |

---

## The Permission Slips

These are the things they need to hear:

> **You don't need to overhaul everything. Just take the next step.**
>
> **You don't need to hire a team. You need systems that work while you sleep.**
>
> **You don't need to be everywhere online. You need to show up in a way that's actually you.**
>
> **You don't need to figure it all out first. Clarity comes from moving.**
>
> **Nobody can give you permission but you. This is you giving it.**
>
> **Success is a decision  -  supported by systems and strategy.**

---

## How We Talk About AI

**Not gimmicky. Practical.**

We don't badge things "AI-powered" for marketing points.

We say: "We build systems that do the repetitive work  -  in your voice, your tone, the way you'd do it if you had time."

### The Frame

| Old Way | Our Way |
|---------|---------|
| Hire a VA to triage inbox | System reads, categorises, drafts response |
| Manually send follow-ups | Triggered by behaviour, sounds like you |
| Write status updates | Generated from project data |
| Chase testimonials | Automated at the right moment |
| Create content constantly | AI drafts in your voice, you polish |

### The Promise
> "You don't need to hire to scale. You need systems."
>
> "We build automation that sounds like you  -  because it learned from you."

### What We Don't Do
- Generic chatbots
- Anything that needs constant babysitting
- Systems that hallucinate to your clients
- Replacements for real relationships

**The goal is leverage, not replacement.**

---

## The Tagline System

**Primary:**
> **Unblock. Unlock. Unleash.**
> *Your business. Your way.*

**Short form (social, wordmark):**
> Unblock. Unlock. Unleash.

**Closing / CTA pairing:**
> Your time is now.

**Supporting lines (use contextually):**
- Clear the path. Build the thing.
- The barriers are smaller than they feel.
- For people who want more than "fine."
- We're fiercely in your corner.

---

## The BHAG (From Their Perspective)

> **What would you do with the space?**

That's what we help them answer. Then we clear the path to get there.

---

## Messaging by Persona

### Launcher (Starting Out)

**Where they are:** Still employed or just starting. Dreaming but not yet doing.

**The feeling:** Excited but uncertain. Wants permission. Scared of making the wrong move.

**Acknowledge (soft):**
> It's hard to start when you're still figuring it out. The gap between "I want to do this" and "I'm actually doing this" can feel huge.

**Reframe:**
> It's not. You don't need a perfect plan. You need a first step  -  and someone in your corner while you take it.

**What they get:**
- Clarity on what you actually need to launch (not everything  -  just the essentials)
- A simple system for getting paid and getting found
- Space to focus on the work, not the setup

**CTA energy:**
> Start small. Start now. We'll figure it out together.

**Primary beat:** Unblock (clarity, permission to start)

---

### Builder (Growing)

**Where they are:** Running, but doing everything themselves. Busy but stuck.

**The feeling:** Stretched thin. Constant context-switching. Working *in* the business, not *on* it.

**Acknowledge (soft):**
> When you're the one doing everything  -  the work, the emails, the invoices, the posting  -  it's hard to find space to think, let alone grow.

**Reframe:**
> You don't need to hire a team. You need systems that handle the repetitive stuff  -  so you can focus on the work that actually moves the needle.

**What they get:**
- Automations that handle the repetitive stuff  -  follow-ups, invoicing, scheduling
- A way to show up online that doesn't eat your week
- Space to work *on* your business, not just *in* it

**CTA energy:**
> Get your time back. One system at a time.

**Primary beat:** Unlock (systems, time back)

---

### Architect (Scaling)

**Where they are:** Established, successful, but capped. The business depends on them too much.

**The feeling:** Successful but stretched. Ready for the next level but unsure how to get there without burning out.

**Acknowledge (soft):**
> You've built something real. But right now, it can't run without you  -  and that's a ceiling.

**Reframe:**
> The next level isn't about working harder. It's about building systems that free up space  -  mental, emotional, practical  -  so you can focus on what's next.

**What they get:**
- Operations that don't depend on you for every decision
- AI and automation that handles client comms, reporting, admin  -  in your voice
- Space to think about growth, impact, what's next

**CTA energy:**
> You've done the hard part. Let's build what comes next.

**Primary beat:** Unleash (scale, space for what's next)

---

## Tone by Persona

| | Launcher | Builder | Architect |
|---|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Energy** | Encouraging, calm | Practical, relieving | Respectful, ambitious |
| **Risk** | Sounding patronising | Sounding like a productivity bro | Sounding like a consultant |
| **Avoid** | "Just believe in yourself!" | "Hustle smarter not harder" | "Leverage your synergies" |
| **Sound like** | A friend who's been there | A peer who found a shortcut | A partner who sees the bigger picture |

---
