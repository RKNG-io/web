# Reckoning — Investment Thesis

---

## The Belief

Most people think innovation needs to be disruptive and solve huge problems.

We think innovation is built out of solving tiny micro-frustrations that you didn't notice were there until they were solved.

---

## The Enemy

Big tech. Monopolies. Lock-ins. Big business.

The giants that have become too big to care.

They build platforms that extract rent. They design lock-ins that punish you for leaving. They charge 10% when 1.5% would do. They make you subscribe to things you should own.

Small businesses deserve better. They deserve tools that work for them, not tools that work on them.

**Reckoning is about levelling the playing field.** Giving small businesses the same operational efficiency the big players have — without the enterprise price tag, the consultants, or the lock-in.

---

## The Bigger Picture

You didn't start your business to drown in admin. You started it for the work — and the life you're building.

That constant context-switching. The background hum of things you haven't got to yet. More time on admin than on the work you actually love.

**That's not a character flaw. That's a systems problem.**

And systems problems have systems solutions.

**The work you love. Without the chaos.** That's what this is for.

---

## Why This Is Sustainable

No huge divisions. No burn. No churn.

Just asking people how they spend their time and providing solutions that have impact from day one — without overhauling their entire business.

**The compounding effect of consistent incremental improvements.**

Each small fix:
- Earns trust
- Teaches us about their business
- Opens the door to the next fix
- Refers others with similar problems

Most startups put AI as the hero of the story. We don't. **Our customers are the hero.** We're just the people who notice the things they've stopped noticing.

---

## The Model

Just-in-time manufacturing of software.

We don't build products and hope customers want them. We build customers and give them exactly what they need, when they need it.

**Modular and adaptive by design:**
- No massive upfront builds
- No "rip and replace" — we work with what they have
- Impact from day one
- Each solution snaps into the next

---

## How It Works

Small business owners buy micro-automations — single solutions to single problems. Booking system. Invoice reminders. Client follow-ups.

Each solution is:
- **Configured from templates** — Not built from scratch, but not generic either
- **Modular** — Lego blocks that snap together over time
- **Delivered fast** — Hours, not weeks

The customer doesn't buy a platform. They buy outcomes, one at a time.

---

## The Flywheel

```
Solve one small problem well
        ↓
    Earn trust
        ↓
Customer comes back for next problem
        ↓
  You learn their business
        ↓
Solutions get better/faster
        ↓
    They refer others
        ↓
   (repeat)
```

Growth comes from trust, not trials. No freemium. They pay, we deliver, trust compounds.

## Traditional SaaS vs Reckoning

| Traditional SaaS | Reckoning |
|------------------|-----------|
| Build product first, find customers who fit | Find customer first, build what they need |
| Inventory model (features built in advance) | Just-in-time (built when purchased) |
| Customer adapts to product | Product adapts to customer |
| Big upfront bet on market | Small iterative bets on individuals |
| Freemium → convert → retain | Paid from day one → trust → expand |
| Growth = acquisition | Growth = wallet share + referral |
| Moat = features | Moat = system + relationships |

---

## What We're Proving

We don't need to prove we understand invoicing, or booking systems, or any specific automation.

We need to prove:
1. **We understand our customers** — Their pain, their language, their constraints
2. **We can earn trust** — Deliver on small promises, earn bigger ones
3. **We can systematise delivery** — Templates, variables, Lego blocks
4. **We can scale without hiring linearly** — Delivery gets faster over time

---

## The Moat

The automations aren't the moat. Anyone can build a Zapier flow.

The moat is:

- **Sharp diagnosis** — Seeing the micro-frustrations customers don't know they have. The 10% fee that could be 1.5%. The manual task that could be automated. The thing they've normalised that doesn't have to be normal.
- **The system that produces solutions** — Ontology, templates, modular architecture
- **The speed of delivery** — Gets faster with every build
- **The trust that earns repeat purchases** — Customers who come back, and refer

---

## The Evolution

| Stage | Customer Experience | Delivery |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| **Now** | Get a diagnostic. Pick a solution. We build it in days. | Human configures templates |
| **Next** | Same experience. Delivered in hours. | System configures, human reviews |
| **Future** | Describe problem, get solution instantly. | Fully automated, human for edge cases |

The customer journey stays simple. The back-end gets more automated. Margins expand.

---

## Why Not Freemium

Freemium optimises for volume, then converts a fraction.

Reckoning optimises for trust. Every customer pays from day one. That filters for people who value their time enough to pay for solutions — exactly the customers worth keeping.

The economics:
- No free tier to support
- No conversion funnel to optimise
- Every interaction is with a paying customer
- Expansion comes from delivering, not upselling
