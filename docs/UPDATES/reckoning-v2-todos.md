# Reckoning v2 — Running Todos

**Last updated:** December 2025

## Architecture & Foundation

- [ ] **Research ontology/schema options** — Evaluate Schema.org, CRM models (HubSpot/Salesforce), accounting standards (UBL, Xero/QuickBooks), booking standards (iCalendar), and integration platform models (Zapier, Make, n8n). Determine best starting point for Reckoning's data model. Criteria: coverage (bookings, invoices, clients, comms), simplicity, adoption by tools customers already use.

## Research & Discovery

- [ ] **Competitor research** — Who else is doing "productised micro-automations" or "automation vending machine" models? Look for: agencies selling packaged automations, no-code platforms with templates, automation-as-a-service plays. Identify what exists, what's missing, and where Reckoning's model is genuinely different.

- [ ] **Threats analysis** — What could kill this model? Consider: platforms adding native automation (Stripe, Calendly doing it themselves), AI tools making DIY trivial (customers don't need us), large players entering the space, integration platforms (Zapier/Make) going downmarket with done-for-you offerings.

## Decisions Pending

- [ ] **Origin story — expand** — Caledonian Road, moving to London, the power of community. What did you see? What did it teach you about small businesses? How does it connect to Reckoning?
