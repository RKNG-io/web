# Reckoning — Website & Photography Brief

**For:** Graphic designer / Photographer  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2025

---

## Overview

Reckoning helps small businesses find what's blocking them — and fix it. One thing at a time. No subscriptions, no lock-ins.

**Core truth:** You didn't start your business to drown in admin. You started it for the work — and the life you're building.

**Theme:** The work you love. Without the chaos.

**The Reckoning:** Not a 50-point action plan. Just what matters now. Clarity on what's blocking you, prioritised next steps, and a path forward.

**CTA:** "Get your Reckoning"

**Tone:** Direct, warm, practical. Customer is the hero. We're the people who notice what they've stopped noticing.

**Humaniser rule:** All copy should sound like something a real person would say to a friend. If it sounds like marketing, rewrite it. No jargon, no corporate speak.

**Key lines:**
- "Stop spinning. Start building."
- "You don't need to overhaul a thing."
- "Small shifts that compound."
- "That's not a character flaw. That's a systems problem."
- "Fix one thing. Come back for the next."
- "Run with it yourself, or let us help."

## Photography Direction

### The Vibe

**Real people. Real tools. Real moments.**

Not stock photos of people smiling at laptops. Actual business owners using the actual solutions — booking links, payment screens, Linktree on a phone, Stripe dashboard.

### What We Need

**Action shots:**
- Hands holding phone showing Linktree / booking link
- Customer tapping "Pay" on a Stripe checkout
- Phone notification: "Payment received"
- Someone scanning a QR code to book
- Calendar with bookings auto-populated

**Context shots (by vertical):**

| Vertical | Context |
|----------|---------|
| Fitness | Gym floor, PT session, yoga studio, boxing ring |
| Wellness | Treatment room, salon chair, spa reception |
| Trades | Van, tools, job site, customer doorstep |
| Events | Venue, DJ booth, boxing ring, crowd, ticket check-in |

**Screen captures / mockups:**
- Linktree page with event links
- Stripe payment link checkout
- "Payment received" confirmation
- Calendar booking confirmation
- Invoice auto-sent notification

### Style Notes

- Natural light preferred
- Not overly polished — authentic, not glossy
- Diverse subjects (age, gender, ethnicity)
- UK context (London if possible)
- Mobile-first framing (vertical video, phone screens prominent)

### Video Direction

Short clips (5-15 seconds) showing:
- The problem → the solution
- "Before: texting back and forth to book. After: link in bio, done."
- Real screen recordings of the tools in action

- Blocked by: Chasing invoices feels awkward → Unlocked by: Automation that follows up, reconciles, and gets you paid
- Blocked by: I need to hire to scale → Unlocked by: Systems that run without headcount

## Vertical-Specific Content

### Fitness (/for/fitness)

**Who:** PTs, gym owners, yoga instructors, online coaches, bootcamp runners

**Headline options:**
- "Stop chasing bookings. Start training."
- "Your clients book, pay, and show up — automatically."

**Pain points:**
1. Booking chaos — back-and-forth messages to schedule
2. No-shows — clients forget, you lose income
3. Payment chasing — awkward "did you transfer?" conversations

**Example automations:**
- Booking link → calendar → auto confirmation + reminder
- No-show → auto rebooking prompt + late cancel fee
- Session complete → invoice sent → payment reminder sequence
- Client inactive 2 weeks → "Missing you" nudge

**Photography:** Gym floor, PT with client, phone showing booking link, payment notification

---

### Wellness (/for/wellness)

**Who:** Massage therapists, physios, chiropractors, nail techs, hair stylists, aestheticians, spas

**Headline options:**
- "Your clients rebook. Automatically."
- "Fill your books without filling your inbox."

**Pain points:**
1. Rebooking gap — clients leave happy, forget to book again
2. Intake forms — paper forms, lost info, same questions every time
3. Last-minute cancellations — empty slots, lost revenue

**Example automations:**
- Appointment ends → "Book your next session" email
- Digital intake form → saved to record → pre-filled next time
- Cancellation → waitlist notification → slot filled
- 6 weeks since visit → "Time for your next treatment?" reminder

**Photography:** Treatment room, salon chair, therapist with client, phone showing rebooking link

---

### Trades (/for/trades)

**Who:** Electricians, plumbers, cleaners, landscapers, handymen, builders, decorators

**Headline options:**
- "Quote, book, invoice — without the paperwork."
- "Run your trade. Not your inbox."

**Pain points:**
1. Quote follow-up — send quote, hear nothing, forget to chase
2. Invoicing delays — job done, invoice sent days later
3. Scheduling mess — texts, calls, WhatsApp, no single source

**Example automations:**
- Quote sent → follow-up at 2, 5, 10 days
- Job complete → invoice generated and sent immediately
- Invoice unpaid 7 days → auto reminder sequence
- Job complete → "Leave us a review?" with direct link

**Photography:** Van, tools, tradesperson at door, phone showing quote sent, invoice notification

---

### Events (/for/events)

**Who:** Promoters, DJs, venues, caterers, florists, photographers, mobile bars, boxing shows

- "From inquiry to invoice — on autopilot."

**Pain points:**
1. Inquiry overwhelm — peak season = inbox explosion
2. Deposit chasing — "just waiting on deposit" for weeks
3. Timeline chaos — multiple events, things slip through

**Example automations:**
- Inquiry received → instant response + questionnaire
- Quote sent → follow-up sequence until decision
- Deposit due → auto reminders until paid
- Event approaching → checklist reminders

**Photography:** Venue, DJ booth, boxing ring, crowd, phone showing Linktree with event tickets, payment confirmation
