# Reckoning Report — Comprehensive Checklist Framework

## The Strategy

Show them everything. Don't hide the work.

The report should feel thorough enough that they think: "This is real. This is everything I need to do." And then: "I could do this myself... or I could just pay someone."

We never say "this is overwhelming" or "let us handle it." We just show the full picture. The weight of the checklist makes the case for support without us having to push.

## The Payment Psychology Point

**Key insight to weave in (for service-based businesses):**

> When you automate payments, you remove yourself from the money conversation entirely. 
> 
> No awkward "so... about the invoice." No chasing. No wondering if they forgot.
> 
> They book. They pay. You show up and do the work.
> 
> That psychological weight — the discomfort of asking to be paid — disappears. And for many people, that's worth more than the hours saved.

**Where this appears:**
- In the Operations/Finance section when discussing payment setup
- As a callout box, not buried in body text
- Framed as insight, not sales pitch

## Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation (This Week)
*The legal and financial basics. Do these before you take money.*

**For Launchers (someone still employed, starting a side business):**

#### ⚖️ Legal

- [ ] **Review your employment contract**
  - Look for: non-compete clauses, moonlighting restrictions, IP assignment, disclosure requirements
  - Key question: Do you need to inform your employer?
  - *If your contract requires disclosure, do it in writing. Keep a copy.*
  - → [Understanding employment contracts and secondary work](https://www.gov.uk/employment-contracts-and-conditions)

- [ ] **Choose your business structure**
  - Sole trader: Simplest, you and the business are one entity
  - Limited company: Separate legal entity, more admin, different tax
  - *Most people start as sole traders and incorporate later if needed*
  - → [Compare business structures (gov.uk)](https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business)

- [ ] **Check if you need any licenses or permits**
  - Depends on your industry (coaching: usually none; food: yes; financial advice: yes)
  - → [gov.uk licence finder](https://www.gov.uk/licence-finder)

- [ ] **Draft a simple client agreement**
  - What you'll deliver, what they'll pay, cancellation terms
  - *You don't need a lawyer. A clear email can work to start.*

#### 📋 Compliance

- [ ] **Register with HMRC for Self Assessment**
  - Required if you'll earn over £1,000/year from self-employment
  - Deadline: 5 October in your second tax year of trading
  - You'll receive a Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) within 10 working days
  - → [Register as a sole trader (gov.uk)](https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment/self-employed)

- [ ] **Understand your National Insurance obligations**
  - Class 2 NI: Credited automatically if profits exceed £6,845
  - Class 4 NI: 6% on profits between £12,570–£50,270
  - → [Self-employed National Insurance rates](https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-national-insurance-rates)

- [ ] **Set up basic record-keeping**
  - Keep invoices, receipts, bank statements for 5 years
  - Separate business and personal expenses (even if same account)
  - *A simple spreadsheet works. Fancy software isn't required yet.*

- [ ] **Check GDPR requirements**
  - If you collect client data (names, emails, session notes): you need a privacy policy
  - If handling sensitive data: consider ICO registration (£40/year for small businesses)
  - → [ICO small business guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/advice-for-small-organisations/)

#### 💰 Finance

- [ ] **Open a business bank account** (recommended, not required for sole traders)
  - Keeps business income separate from personal
  - Makes tax return much easier
  - Many offer free accounts for first year

- [ ] **Set up a way to get paid**
  - Options: Stripe, PayPal, bank transfer, GoCardless
  - *Automated payments mean you never have to ask for money*
  
  > **Why this matters beyond convenience:**
  > 
  > When payment is built into booking, you remove yourself from the money conversation. No awkward follow-ups. No "did they forget?" anxiety. They book, they pay, you show up.
  > 
  > For many people, eliminating that psychological weight is worth more than the hours saved.

- [ ] **Decide your pricing**
  - Research competitors
  - Calculate your costs + desired hourly rate
  - *It's easier to lower prices than raise them. Start where you want to be.*

- [ ] **Understand tax deadlines**
  - Tax year: 6 April – 5 April
  - Self Assessment deadline: 31 January (online)
  - Payment deadline: 31 January (with possible payments on account in July)

---

### Phase 2: Operations (Weeks 2-4)
*The systems that let you work with clients smoothly.*

#### ⚙️ Operations

- [ ] **Set up online booking**
  - Options: Calendly (free tier), Cal.com (open source), Acuity
  - Link payment to booking so clients pay when they book
  - Set buffer time between sessions

- [ ] **Create a client intake process**
  - What info do you need before the first session?
  - Questionnaire, contract, payment — automate the sequence

- [ ] **Set up basic invoicing** (if not using payment-at-booking)
  - Options: Wave (free), Xero, QuickBooks
  - Include: your details, client details, description, amount, due date, payment method

- [ ] **Create session templates/frameworks**
  - What's your process? Document it.
  - Makes delivery consistent and takes thinking out of each session

- [ ] **Set up a simple CRM or client tracker**
  - Even a spreadsheet: Name, contact, sessions booked, notes
  - Know who you're working with and what you've discussed

#### 🌐 Presence

- [ ] **Register your domain name**
  - Check availability, register for 2+ years
  - Options: Namecheap, Google Domains, Porkbun
  - *Do this early. Good names get taken.*

- [ ] **Get a simple website live**
  - One page is enough: who you help, how you help, book now
  - Options: Carrd (£19/year), Squarespace, Framer
  - *Don't wait for "perfect." Live and iterate.*

- [ ] **Set up Google Business Profile** (if relevant)
  - Free visibility when people search for your service locally
  - → [Create a Google Business Profile](https://www.google.com/business/)

- [ ] **Claim your social handles**
  - Even if you won't use them immediately, secure the username

---

### Phase 3: Growth (Month 2+)
*Getting visible and building momentum.*

#### 📣 Marketing

- [ ] **Tell your network**
  - Personal outreach to warm contacts
  - LinkedIn post or email announcing your services
  - *Your first clients usually come from people who already know you*

- [ ] **Create a simple content plan**
  - What can you share that demonstrates expertise?
  - 1-2 posts per week is enough to start

- [ ] **Set up an email list**
  - Options: Mailchimp (free tier), ConvertKit, Buttondown
  - Even 10 subscribers is a start

- [ ] **Ask for testimonials**
  - After each engagement, ask: "Would you be willing to write a few sentences about working together?"
  - Use on website and social

- [ ] **Set up review requests**
  - Automate: after session ends, email asks for Google review
  - Social proof compounds over time

#### ⚖️ Legal (Ongoing)

- [ ] **Consider professional indemnity insurance**
  - Covers you if a client claims your advice caused them harm
  - Typical cost: £100-300/year for coaches/consultants
  - *Some industries require it*

- [ ] **Create terms and conditions for your website**
  - What are the rules for using your site and buying from you?
  - → [gov.uk guidance on Ts&Cs](https://www.gov.uk/online-and-distance-selling-for-businesses)

## Employment Considerations (Moonlighting Section)

**For anyone starting a business while still employed:**

### Before You Start

Your employment contract likely includes clauses that affect what you can do outside work:

1. **Non-compete clauses** — You may be restricted from working in similar industries or with competitors
2. **Moonlighting restrictions** — Some contracts require employer approval for any outside work
3. **IP assignment** — Work created during employment may belong to your employer
4. **Confidentiality** — You cannot use employer information in your business
5. **Disclosure requirements** — You may need to inform your employer in writing

**What to do:**
- Find your contract and read it carefully
- Look for sections on "outside employment," "conflict of interest," or "secondary work"
- If in doubt, consult an employment lawyer before you start

### Key Legal Points

- **Moonlighting is not illegal in the UK** — but your contract may restrict it
- **Duty of good faith** — Even without explicit clauses, you can't compete with your employer or use their resources
- **Working Time Regulations** — Combined hours across jobs shouldn't exceed 48/week unless you've opted out
- **Zero-hours contracts** — Exclusivity clauses are banned; employer cannot stop you taking other work

### If Your Contract Requires Disclosure

- Put it in writing
- Be specific about what your business does
- Explain why there's no conflict of interest
- Keep a copy of all correspondence

*Not legal advice. If your situation is complex, consult an employment solicitor.*

## Trigger Points for Follow-Up

**Each phase completion is an opportunity to reach back out:**

| Trigger | Follow-Up |
|---------|-----------|
| Phase 1 complete | "You've laid the foundation. Ready to build your systems? Here's what Phase 2 looks like..." |
| Phase 2 complete | "Your operations are set. Now let's get you visible. Here's Phase 3..." |
| Phase 3 complete | "You're live and running. Let's talk about what's working and what needs refining." |
| 90 days from start | "Check-in: How's it going? What's the biggest blocker right now?" |
| First testimonial received | "Congrats on the social proof! Want help turning this into a case study?" |

**Dashboard tracking:**
- Each checklist item is clickable
- We see which items they've completed
- Triggers automated emails at phase milestones
- "Stuck" items (not completed for 14+ days) could trigger help offers

## Design Notes for PDF

### Make It Feel Like a Lot (Without Being Overwhelming)

- Show the full checklist on one page — it's comprehensive
- But break the action into phases — it's achievable
- Each phase has a clear "when you're done with this, you'll have X"
- Visual progress indicators

### The Implicit Message

The checklist itself makes the case for support. We don't need to say:
- "This is a lot, let us help"
- "Too complicated? We can do it for you"

We just show the work. The weight of it speaks for itself.

Then the Path Forward page shows:
- DIY (with full checklist access)
- Supported (we do the hard parts)
- Let's talk (not sure yet)

All three are valid. We've already proven our value by showing them exactly what they need to do.
