# Social Media Services  -  Bespoke & Easy to Learn

## Philosophy

We don't "do social media for you"  -  we build you a **system you can run yourself**.

Most business owners don't need an agency posting for them. They need:
1. A plan they understand
2. Templates they can customise
3. Tools configured for their workflow
4. Training so they feel confident

Then it's theirs. No dependency. No monthly retainer for something they could do in 30 minutes a day.

## Positioning

### For Leapers
> "You don't need to be on social media 24/7. You need a system that makes showing up feel easy  -  so you can focus on actually running your business."

### For Scrappy Survivors
> "You're already posting, but it's chaos. Let's turn that into a system you can batch in 2 hours a week."

### For Overwhelmed Owners
> "You're not posting because you're too busy putting out fires. Once we systematise operations, we can set up social to run on autopilot."
