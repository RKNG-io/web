# UK Automation OS  -  Master Catalogue

A comprehensive infrastructure layer for UK businesses: presence → operations → automation → intelligence → creative.

This catalogue is built around the five universal layers all UK businesses need, and includes industry-specific extensions for:

- Law Firms
- Accountants
- Gyms / Fitness Studios
- Meal Prep / Chefs
- E-commerce
- Creators / Social Brands

Every module is intentionally tool-agnostic (n8n, Zapier, Make, Vercel, Stripe UK, Xero, FreeAgent, OAuth APIs, etc.).
